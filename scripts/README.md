# Modules

The goal is to let you add and remove the modules you want.

Currently installed modules:

- [Key modifiers](./key_modifiers/)
- [Weapon settings](./weapon_slot_settings.cfg)
- [Quick loadout switch](./loadout_switch.cfg)
- [Quick class switch](./class_switch.cfg)
- [Silly](./silly.cfg)

## Working with modules

Some of these only need to be called [when the game loads](../autoexec.cfg), and others need to be called with [every class change](../classes/base_class.cfg) in order to establish a starting point.
